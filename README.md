### Before Booth Setup

> Initially, booth setup proved challenging as lighter components were at risk of getting blown away.

![Setting up the booth](setup2.jpg)
> In this image, our team can be seen setting up the booth. To address the challenge of lighter components, we improvised by taping them onto a board that already had descriptions. This allowed us to secure the components and prevent them from being displaced.
