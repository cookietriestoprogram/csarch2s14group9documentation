### Before Booth Setup
![Empty table before booth setup](setup1.jpg)
- Initially, booth setup proved challenging as lighter components were at risk of getting blown away in the AC draft.

- In this image, our team can be seen setting up the booth. To address the challenge of lighter components, we improvised by taping them onto a board that already had descriptions. This allowed us to secure the components and prevent them from being displaced.



### After Booth Setup
