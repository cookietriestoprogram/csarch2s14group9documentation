### Before Booth Setup
- [setup1.jpg]
- Initially, booth setup proved challenging as lighter components were at risk of getting blown away in the AC draft. To resolve this issue, we taped the components onto a board that already had descriptions.
- The placement of components followed a timeline format, where visitors would proceed from left to right, learning about the project's progression from its inception to the current state.
